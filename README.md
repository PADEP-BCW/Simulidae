Prosimulium and Simulium analysis

This analysis examines the occurrence, abundance, and spatio-temporal dynamics of Prosimulium and Simulium to provide insight into proliferation of these taxa throughout Pennsylvania as a whole, and within each DEP region. A secondary part of the analysis looks at the influence of increasing Prosimulium and Simulium relative abundance on metric and IBI scores.

This was done to provide insight into sampling and assessment considerations associated with each of these taxa. The results hopefully provide practical considerations for biologists to put into practice.
